my App.js should be able to run, the css file is the boilerplate I created when I set up the project.

Everything should be boilerplate from npx create-react-app drag :

    "konva": "^8.3.5",
    "react": "^18.0.0",
    "react-bootstrap": "^2.3.0",
    "react-dnd": "^16.0.1",
    "react-dnd-html5-backend": "^16.0.1",
    "react-dom": "^18.0.0",
    "react-konva": "^18.0.0-0",
    "react-konva-utils": "^0.3.0",
